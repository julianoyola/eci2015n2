	<h3>Exercise 6: Bypassing taint analysis</h3>

	<p>
	In the course, we mentioned that taint analysis is not effective for
	malicious code. The reason for that is the power that the attacker
	has to bypass the analysis by exploiting the control flow constructs.
	</p>
	<p>
	In this exercise, you are the attacker who provides malicious code. Your goal is
	to deploy the function <code>bypass</code> which bypasses the taint analysis. More
	specifically, you should implement the following function in Python:
	</p>
	
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	def bypass(some_string):
	...
	end
	</pre>
	<p>which <strong>always</strong> returns an untainted string.</p>
	
	<p>
	Your function should not be responsible to raise an alarm of the taint analysis. For
	instance, the following code should run without reporting any problems:
	</p>

	<pre class="prettyprint">
	tstring = taint(&quot;This is tainted data&quot;)
	# If you run tainted(tstring) in the Python prompt, you should see True
	ustring = bypass(tstring)
	# Now, ustring should have the same value as tstring but it is not tainted
	# If you run tainted(ustring) in the Python prompt, you should see False
	</pre>
